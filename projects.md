### [QuITO](https://github.com/chatterjee-d/QuITO) | Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization

-   A direct multiple shooting algorithm to solve a class of constrained nonlinear minimum energy optimal control problems.
-   This technique is based on the theory of approximate approximations - a quasi-interpolation scheme.
-   A novel way of transcribing the optimal control problem (OCP) into a nonlinear program (NLP) is designed.

### [AUV-IITB](http://auv-iitb.org/) | Underwater Robotics

-   AUV-IITB is a multidisciplinary team of 50+ members at IIT Bombay focused on developing autonomous underwater vehicles from the perspective to handle real-time tasks.
-   The vehicles are capable of way-point navigation, object detection, robotic actuation, acoustic communication etc. underwater.

### [Path Optimization for Combinatorial Problems](https://github.com/Prajwal-Prathiksh/Museum-Path-Optimization/tree/main/presentations)

-   A toolkit of optimization models developed to solve the travelling-salesman problem.
-   Heuristic and exact algorithms for combinatorial optimization of mixed-integer programming problem

### [Mini Games](https://github.com/nakulrandad/Games)

A 2D game developed as a hobby project wich includes designing the enemy & player battleships, background effects, music additions and creating powerups.

### [Solar Radiation Prediction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cYWwQR02r17Bgc7hXHiDjqEfJLtR3x6AE6GK5HvttNw/edit?usp=sharing) | Machine Learning

-   Implemented model which predicts irradiation falling on the ground for different prediction horizons using SVM (Support Vector Machine) and compares with the Neural Networks.
-   The multilayer perceptron architecture in NN has three layers with ReLU activation.

### [Time Optimal River Crossing Problem](https://github.com/nakulrandad/Optimal-Control-Theory)

A navigation strategy devised for a high dimensional path problem using Pontryagin’s maximum principle

## Positions of Responsibility

### [Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle]() | Project Lead

A joint effort by IIT Bombay (Incharge: Prof. L. Vachhani) and Larsen & Toubro Defence under IMPRINT IIC scheme by Gov. of India through Ministry of Education and Dept. of Science and Technology.

### [Student Mentor](https://smp.gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/) | IIT Bombay
Mentor of 18 students, selected based on extensive interview and peer reviews, that provide necessary support, academic and otherwise freshmen and sophomore students.

### [Convener](https://www.facebook.com/tinkererIITB/) | Tinkerers’ Laboratory, IIT Bombay
A 24*7 'Makerspace' for innovators that is open to all the students to promote hands on learning experience.
