### [Research Assistant](https://mornik.web.illinois.edu/research/group/)

<details>
  <summary>Welfare Maximization Algorithm for Solving Budget-Constrained Multi-Component POMDPs</summary>
  
  <ul>
    <li>An algorithm for optimal policy synthesis for very large state space multi-component POMDPs within a budget.</li>
    <li>Motivated by the problem of finding optimal maintenance and inspection policies for a group of infrastructure components.</li>
    <li>Developed a simulator in Julia for simulating the component-POMDP and solving it using the POMCP algorithm.</li>
    <li>Devised an optimal budget distribution algorithm and increased computational feasibility and efficiency of the optimal policy synthesis.</li>
  </ul>

### [RiP](https://github.com/Manavvora/RiP_Planner) | Risk Aware Planner

<details>
  <summary>Reachability-Based Risk-Aware Path Planning</summary>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A path planning algorithm which generates a minimum risk path, in the presence of obstacles, by leveraging the teachnique of reachability based trajectory synthesis.</li>
    <li>Risk is minimized by assigning risk boundaries around obstacles and the final trajectory is generated by optimizing for path length as well as risk.</li>
    <li>The algorithm is most suited for cases where obstacles are adverserial and for missions where safety is of utmost priority.</li>
