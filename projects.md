### [Research Assistant](https://mornik.web.illinois.edu/research/group/) | Welfare Maximization Algorithm for Solving Budget-Constrained Multi-Component POMDPs

-   An algorithm for optimal policy synthesis for very large state space multi-component POMDPs within a budget 
-   Motivated by the problem of finding optimal maintenance and inspection policies for a group of infrastructure components
-   Developed a simulator in Julia for simulating the component-POMDP and solving it using the POMCP algorithm
-   Devised an optimal budget distribution algorithm and increased computational feasibility and efficiency of the optimal policy synthesis

### [AUV-IITB](http://auv-iitb.org/) | Underwater Robotics

-   AUV-IITB is a multidisciplinary team of 50+ members at IIT Bombay focused on developing autonomous underwater vehicles from the perspective to handle real-time tasks.
-   The vehicles are capable of way-point navigation, object detection, robotic actuation, acoustic communication etc. underwater.

### [Path Optimization for Combinatorial Problems](https://github.com/Prajwal-Prathiksh/Museum-Path-Optimization/tree/main/presentations)

-   A toolkit of optimization models developed to solve the travelling-salesman problem.
-   Heuristic and exact algorithms for combinatorial optimization of mixed-integer programming problem

### [Mini Games](https://github.com/nakulrandad/Games)

A 2D game developed as a hobby project wich includes designing the enemy & player battleships, background effects, music additions and creating powerups.

### [Solar Radiation Prediction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cYWwQR02r17Bgc7hXHiDjqEfJLtR3x6AE6GK5HvttNw/edit?usp=sharing) | Machine Learning

-   Implemented model which predicts irradiation falling on the ground for different prediction horizons using SVM (Support Vector Machine) and compares with the Neural Networks.
-   The multilayer perceptron architecture in NN has three layers with ReLU activation.

### [Time Optimal River Crossing Problem](https://github.com/nakulrandad/Optimal-Control-Theory)

A navigation strategy devised for a high dimensional path problem using Pontryagin’s maximum principle
