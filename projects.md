### [Research Assistant](https://mornik.web.illinois.edu/research/group/) | Welfare Maximization Algorithm for Solving Budget-Constrained Multi-Component POMDPs

-   An algorithm for optimal policy synthesis for very large state space multi-component POMDPs within a budget. 
-   Motivated by the problem of finding optimal maintenance and inspection policies for a group of infrastructure components.
-   Developed a simulator in Julia for simulating the component-POMDP and solving it using the POMCP algorithm.
-   Devised an optimal budget distribution algorithm and increased computational feasibility and efficiency of the optimal policy synthesis.

### [Lunar Lander](https://github.com/Manavvora/Lunar_RL) | Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Trajectory Synthesis

-   Performance analysis and comparison of DQN, SARSA, Q-Learning and Monte Carlo RL algorithms for optimal landing of a lunar lander on the surface of the moon in the presence of external disturbances.
-   Created animation using the Python Gym Environment to visualize the performance of all algorithms.
-   Obtained the final trajectory of spacecraft, from the animations, under different algorithms using object tracking in OpenCV.

### [RiP](https://github.com/Manavvora/RiP_Planner) | Risk Aware Planner

-   A path planning algorithm which generates a minimum risk path, in the presence of obstacles, by leveraging the teachnique of reachability based trajectory synthesis.
-   Risk is minimized by assigning risk boundaries around obstacles and the final trajectory is generated by optimizing for path length as well as risk
-   The algorithm is most suited for cases where obstacles are adverserial and for missions where safety is of utmost priority

### [Mini Games](https://github.com/nakulrandad/Games)

A 2D game developed as a hobby project wich includes designing the enemy & player battleships, background effects, music additions and creating powerups.

### [Solar Radiation Prediction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cYWwQR02r17Bgc7hXHiDjqEfJLtR3x6AE6GK5HvttNw/edit?usp=sharing) | Machine Learning

-   Implemented model which predicts irradiation falling on the ground for different prediction horizons using SVM (Support Vector Machine) and compares with the Neural Networks.
-   The multilayer perceptron architecture in NN has three layers with ReLU activation.

### [Time Optimal River Crossing Problem](https://github.com/nakulrandad/Optimal-Control-Theory)

A navigation strategy devised for a high dimensional path problem using Pontryagin’s maximum principle
