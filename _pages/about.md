I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/), working with [Prof. Melkior Ornik in the Learning, Autonomy, Decision, and Control (LEADCAT) Lab](https://mornik.web.illinois.edu/research/group/). I previously completed my bachelor’s degree (with honors) in [Aerospace Engineering](https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/home/) with a minor in [Systems and Controls Engineering](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/) from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay)](http://www.iitb.ac.in/). My research focuses on developing scalable algorithms for multi-agent systems and robotics in constrained, stochastic environments. In particular, I strive to create methods that can seamlessly adapt to a variety of resource, safety, and temporal constraints—ultimately enabling robust autonomy across diverse real-world settings.

Beyond my research, I’m passionate about sports (both watching and playing), staying active at the gym, traveling, discovering new cuisines, and immersing myself in music—especially EDM. I am also a huge [Manchester United](https://www.manutd.com/) fan, even though it’s tough times right now.
