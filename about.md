## Workspace

My name is Manav Vora and I'm a Master's student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
Currently, I am working as a research assistant, with Prof. Melkior Ornik, in the LEADCAT lab at UIUC where I'm conducting my research in 
sequential decision making, artificial intelligence and optimal policy synthesis for stochastic systems. I completed my undergraduate 
studies with honors at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with a major in Aerospace Engineering
and minor in System & Controls Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in aerial robotics, deep learning and control. 
As a researcher, my work is guided by 
Albert Einstein's quote : 
**“Strive not to be a success but rather to be of value.”**  

When I'm not in the lab, I'm either working out in the gym or watching sports. I'm a huge sports fan and enjoy watching cricket, basketball 
(favourite team : Golden State Warriors) and tennis (favourite player : Roger Federer). I've recently also developed a a newfound interest in 
American Football (both NFL and college football).
