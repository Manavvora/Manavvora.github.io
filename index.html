    I am Nakul Randad. I'm passionate about exploring and learning 'new stuff'. Maybe it is not just with me;
    humans are curious. A famous quote by Leonardo da Vinci (because why not):
    <strong>“To develop a complete mind: Study the science of art; Study the art of science.
      Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.”</strong>
    I have loads of pieces of wisdom to share but if I continue, you will call me a hypocrite.

    I pursued my undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with a major in Aerospace Engineering
    and minor in System & Controls Engineering. Currently I work as a Quantitative Analyst at Goldman Sachs.
    Not planning to work on anything brilliant (crazy) as of now but stay tuned!
